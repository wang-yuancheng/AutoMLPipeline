# Automated Machine Learning Pipeline
This repository contains the code and materials for an end-to-end ML pipeline that predicts cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and suggests personalized treatment actions to reduce that risk. 
The pipeline includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment via a Flask API.
