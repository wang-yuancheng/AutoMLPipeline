## Introduction
CVD remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. This project aims to apply the principles of data science to predict the probability of CVD based on various health indicators.

### Problem Definition
Can we predict whether a person is likely to suffer from cardiovascular disease based on measurable health indicators?
This is a binary classification problem where the target variable is `cardio` (1: presence of CVD, 0: absence).

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 70,000 records of patients data, 11 features + target.<br>

Link: [Cardiovascular Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset)<br>
Author: Svetlana Ulianova<br>
Platform: Kaggle<br>
File: [cardio_train (Original)](data/cardio_train%20(Original).csv)<br>

Note: Transformed dataset after feature engineering is [cardio_train](data/cardio_train.csv) 

## Data Preparation
### Data Cleaning
- Removed ID count
- Transformed `age` feature from days to years
- Transformed `height` feature from cm to m
- Removed rows with medically impossible values:<br>
`systolic_bp <= 0, diastolic_bp <= 0, pulse_pressure <= 0, mean_arterial_pressure <= 0`
- Removed data points outside boxplot whiskers using the IQR method
- Reset DataFrame index after row removal

### Feature Engineering
- Added three derived medical features using standard clinical formulas:
    - Body Mass Index (BMI): `BMI= Weight / (Height)^2`
    - Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP): `MAP = (Systolic BP + 2 √ó Diastolic BP) / 3`
    - Pulse Pressure (PP): `PP = Systolic BP ‚Äì Diastolic DBP`

#### üî∫ Top Positively Correlated Features with Cardiovascular Disease

<details>
<summary><code>systolic_bp</code>, <code>mean_arterial_pressure</code>, <code>diastolic_bp</code>, <code>pulse_pressure</code>, <code>age_years</code>, and <code>body_mass_index</code> have moderate positive correlations</summary>

<br>

- **Systolic Blood Pressure (`systolic_bp`)**: 0.41  
- **Mean Arterial Pressure (`mean_arterial_pressure`)**: 0.39  
- **Diastolic Blood Pressure (`diastolic_bp`)**: 0.33  
- **Pulse Pressure (`pulse_pressure`)**: 0.31  
- **Age (`age_years`)**: 0.23  
- **Body Mass Index (`body_mass_index`)**: 0.17  

</details>

These suggest that individuals with higher blood pressure, higher BMI, and older age are more likely to have cardiovascular disease.

#### üß™ Lab Indicators (Cholesterol and Glucose Levels)

<details>
<summary><code>cholesterol_level_2</code>, <code>cholesterol_level_3</code>, <code>glucose_level_2</code>, and <code>glucose_level_3</code> show smaller but noticeable correlations</summary>

<br>

- **Cholesterol Level 3 (`cholesterol_level_3`)**: 0.19  
- **Cholesterol Level 2 (`cholesterol_level_2`)**: 0.07  
- **Glucose Level 2 (`glucose_level_2`)**: 0.08  
- **Glucose Level 3 (`glucose_level_3`)**: 0.07  

</details>

These indicators show smaller, yet noticeable positive correlations with cardiovascular disease, indicating some association with elevated risk.

---

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Weak or Negligible Correlation Features

<details>
<summary><code>smoking_status</code>, <code>alcohol_consumption</code>, <code>physical_activity</code>, and <code>gender</code> show very weak correlation</summary>

<br>

- **Smoking Status (`smoking_status`)**: 0.03  
- **Alcohol Consumption (`alcohol_consumption`)**: 0.01  
- **Physical Activity (`physical_activity`)**: 0.04  
- **Gender (`gender`)**: 0.05  

</details>

These variables show weak linear correlation with cardiovascular disease, though they may still contribute value in non-linear models or through interaction effects.

---

#### üîó Notable Inter-Feature Correlations (Multicollinearity Risk)
- **Systolic vs. Diastolic Blood Pressure**: 0.76  
  Although strongly correlated, both provide distinct clinical information: **systolic pressure** reflects the force during heartbeats, while **diastolic pressure** measures pressure between beats. Retaining both can be valuable for models interpreting cardiovascular function more holistically.
- **BMI vs. Weight**: 0.84  
  High correlation suggests redundancy, as BMI is derived from weight and height. Consider keeping only one or evaluating their individual predictive power.
- **MAP vs. BP Values**: > 0.90  
  Mean Arterial Pressure is a derived metric from systolic and diastolic values. It may be excluded to reduce redundancy unless it offers clearer interpretability or predictive strength.

## Feature Selection
From the above findings, we identified the following features as most relevant for predicting cardiovascular disease:

- **Age**
- **BMI**
- **Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)**
- **Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP)**
- **Cholesterol Level**
- **Glucose Level**

These features showed meaningful correlation with the target variable and are retained as inputs for model training.

To reduce redundancy and improve model efficiency:
- We **dropped `height` and `weight`**, since **BMI** already captures that relationship.
- We **excluded derived variables** like **Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)** and **Pulse Pressure**, which are calculated from SBP and DBP, to avoid multicollinearity.

## Modelling

### Algorithms Used
The following algorithms were used for model comparison:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Gaussian Naive Bayes
3. k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM - RBF Kernel)
5. Decision Tree Classifier
6. Random Forest Classifier
7. XGBoost Classifier
8. Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)
9. Voting Soft Ensemble (Soft Voting)

### Evaluation Metrics
The models were evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Measures the proportion of correctly predicted instances.
- **Recall**: Focuses on the ability of the model to identify positive instances (minimizing false negatives).
- **ROC AUC**: Measures the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, indicating the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.

### Results
The performance of each model is summarized in the table below:

| **Model**                  | **Accuracy** | **Recall** | **ROC AUC** |
|----------------------------|-------------:|-----------:|------------:|
| Logistic Regression        | 0.712       | 0.611      | 0.773       |
| Gaussian Naive Bayes       | 0.697       | 0.580      | 0.757       |
| k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)  | 0.683       | 0.651      | 0.731       |
| Support Vector Machine (SVM - RBF) | 0.713 | 0.592      | 0.769       |
| Decision Tree              | 0.621       | 0.605      | 0.620       |
| Random Forest              | 0.680       | 0.641      | 0.737       |
| XGBoost                    | 0.713       | 0.635      | 0.775       |
| Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) | 0.719     | 0.640      | 0.782       |
| Voting Soft Ensemble       | 0.718       | 0.634      | 0.782       |

### Model Training
Each model was trained on the dataset using the preprocessed features and target variable. The training process included:
1. Splitting the data into training and testing sets (80/20 split).
2. Feature scaling using MinMaxScaler for continuous and binary variables.
3. One-hot encoding for ordinal features to avoid redundancy.
4. Evaluating model predictions on the test set and calculating the metrics mentioned above.

Additional details about the training setup:
- Hyperparameters were set to reasonable defaults (e.g., `max_iter=1000` for Logistic Regression, `n_neighbors=5` for kNN).
- For ensemble methods like Random Forest and Voting Classifier, 50 estimators were used.
- MLP utilized a single hidden layer with 200 units, trained over 200 iterations.
